There are six attributes associated with each request made by a customer:

Request id: A unique identifier of the request
Time of request: The date and time at which the customer made the trip request
Drop-off time: The drop-off date and time, in case the trip was completed 
Pick-up point: The point from which the request was made
Driver id: The unique identification number of the driver
Status of the request: The final status of the trip, that can be either completed, cancelled by the driver or no cars available
Note: For this assignment, only the trips to and from the airport are being considered.

 

Data Cleaning and Preparation - Hints

Identify the data quality issues and clean the data so that you can use it for analysis.
Ensure that the dates and time are in the proper format. Derive new variables which will be useful for analysis.
 

Results Expected
1.Visually identify the most pressing problems for Uber. 
Hint: Create plots to visualise the frequency of requests that get cancelled or show 'no cars available'; identify the most problematic types of requests (city to airport / airport to city etc.) and the time slots (early mornings, late evenings etc.) using plots
2.Find out the gap between supply and demand and show the same using plots.
3.Find the time slots when the highest gap exists
4.Find the types of requests (city-airport or airport-city) for which the gap is the most severe in the identified time slots
